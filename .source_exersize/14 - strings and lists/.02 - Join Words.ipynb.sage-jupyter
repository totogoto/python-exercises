It needs to format the sentence as follows \n\n`Found A,B,C and D`\n\nNote: There will me more atleast 3 items. You will need to adjust where to insert ` and ` in the sentence\n\n### What you need to know\n\n- The functions `move()` to move.\n- calling `move()` in front of a wall causes otto to crash into the wall and the program errors out. Please take care of otto ðŸ¤—\n\n- The function `object_here()` returns the object in the current cell (in this case \"banana\" on cells with banana)\n\n#### Python string spliting\n`'sep'.join(str)`The `join()` string method returns a string by joining all the elements of an iterable (list, string, tuple), separated by a string separator.\n"}
